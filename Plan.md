Hey Claude! I wanted to create a new project. What is this project? This project is essentially a frontend for a models.json which I have that will show as a directory of all the different models, plus providers and their details at one single place. There is a combined json, there is a folder called combined which has json for each project provider that shows all the model IDs along with the pricing and as well as the features that are possible for that particular model. The aim for this project is to become the world-class directory of sorts so that anyone who wants access to model pricing, model context window, does a model support tool calling and everything at one particular place. We have to create a frontend for it; this is more like a marketing plusfree tool activity that we are doing for Portkey. The aim for this project is to become like a SEO hub plus more like a contribution to the open source world where people and other projects can use this directory to access their model pricing and model details. Ideally we will also have API built for it. We will also have let's say a model card. So when you click on a model, it's a table which shows everything. You can search on it. You can filter things. You can also click on a card and it gives you a very simple shareable card which looks absolutely beautiful. The design for this particular project is absolutely important. I have given you @styles.md  which I have got from OpenAID that we will use over the entire project to make sure we have a consistent design team. Then it looks absolutely beautiful inspired by world-class people like Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive should be very happy with this project. Now the basic front-end of what we want would essentially have a hero section. What do you think the hero section should say? It's an open-source project, there is a Portkey logo, there is hyperlinks on the top bar for API and Portkey's open source GitHub which has the list of these models, and then there is a table in between. There's also a customer logo section. This is a marketing activity that we'll also do this customer-ribbon. I have given you three assets for customer-ribbon that will have an animation. It will keep loading and then it will show all the customer logos one by one. We need to add more things to it. I want to brainstorm with you to figure out how we can make the best thing possible. There are other projects who do that so there's Open Router who have a very beautiful models page, there is also models.dev website which is also something similar. We also want to be a competitor but we want to be 10 times better than this. We'll brainstorm and think of a way on how we can make better than this. If you want any information with me to do that, you are the world-class builder, your world-class product manager, you are a world-class designer, your world-class coder who will help me build these things together.
